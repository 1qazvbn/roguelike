# Level2 Roguelike

Mini procedurally generated roguelite written in vanilla JS and Canvas.

## Running
Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No build step required.

To set a deterministic seed, open with `?seed=myseed` in the URL. The last used seed and best depth are stored in `localStorage`.

## Controls
- **WASD** – move
- **Mouse** – aim, **Left Click** – shoot
- **Space** – dash
- **Left Shift** – crouch (shows hitbox)
- **Esc** – pause

Goal: reach the stairs to descend. Each floor increases difficulty by 10%.
